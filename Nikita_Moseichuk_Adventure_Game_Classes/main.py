# Nikita Moseichuk - Adventure Game
#The Python script creates a text-based adventure game where players navigate a grid-based map, encountering obstacles like monsters and chests. 
#They can interact with these objects, collect items, and use inventory items like health potions and coins. The game progresses through levels, 
#with players needing keys to unlock doors and advance. The script manages game logic, player input, and map generation.
